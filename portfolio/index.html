<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of things I&rsquo;ve created on over the last few years, in reverse-chronological order. Only the first few show off my skills in any significant way, but I figured I&rsquo;d show off everything for completeness and to show personal growth and whatnot.</p>
<h2 id="ray-tracing-galleryhttpsgithubcomexpensesray-tracing-gallery-2021---present"><a href="https://github.com/expenses/ray-tracing-gallery">Ray Tracing Gallery</a> (2021 - Present)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rust with Vulkan via the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ash">ash</a> crate</li>
<li>2710 lines of code (2580 rust, 130 glsl)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/ray-tracing-gallery.png" alt="Some ray-traced toruses"></p>
<p>I started working on this to get better at using Vulkan itself as well as learning the <code>VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline</code> extension and friends and I&rsquo;m absolutely having a blast. Here&rsquo;s a bunch of things that I&rsquo;ve implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both bindless textures and model buffers (via the very cool <code>GL_EXT_buffer_reference</code> extension)</li>
<li>Top-Level Acceleration Structure updates so that the scene can change dynamically (this was harder than it should have been, as <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/issues/1641">the Vulkan Spec didn&rsquo;t clarify how to do this</a>)</li>
<li>Soft shadows - still work-in-progress and not merged into the main branch yet. <a href="/soft_shadows.mp4">Click here for a video demo</a>.</li>
<li>Implements a fix for shadow terminator problems from <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4842-7185-8.pdf">Ray Tracing Gems II</a>, Chapter 4.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dune-scenehttpsgithubcomexpensesdune_scene-2021---present"><a href="https://github.com/expenses/dune_scene">Dune Scene</a> (2021 - Present)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rust with <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs">wgpu-rs</a></li>
<li>3400 lines of code (2500 rust, 900 glsl)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/dune_scene.png" alt="An image of a desert scene with some spaceships flying above it"></p>
<p>An ongoing experiment in seeing how much stuff I can animate in a browser using compute shaders. I also have <a href="https://github.com/expenses/dune_scene/pull/1">a pull request up</a> that adds compute shaders for the full animation pipeline, from sampling animation to computing the joint transforms. I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone do this before (perhaps for good reason) and I&rsquo;m super proud of the system I came up with. The Shadows are rendered via Cascaded Shadow Maps, which I implemented <a href="https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan/tree/master/examples/shadowmappingcascade">based on the Sascha Willems Vulkan example</a>. This is also the first time I&rsquo;ve played around with PBR BRDFs in shaders (albeit ones that I copy-pasted).</p>
<p>Playable online at expenses.github.io/dune_scene using <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/wiki/Implementation-Status#firefox">a browser with webgpu enabled</a>, although this could break at any time.</p>
<h2 id="first-person-projecthttpsgithubcomexpensesfps-2020---2021"><a href="https://github.com/expenses/fps/">First Person Project</a> (2020 - 2021)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rust with <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs">wgpu-rs</a></li>
<li>~ 6600 lines of code (6000 rust, 600 glsl)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/fps.png" alt="Two first person views of colourful levels"></p>
<p>A first-person thing that I started and have a decent renderer for, but barely made any progress on in terms of gameplay. It has this cool system where I create &lsquo;empty&rsquo; objects in blender with custom properties that get exported to the <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF">gltf</a> file and then are capable of spawning entities. I have one shader that makes lightmaps for the static level, and a compute shader that creates a &lsquo;light volume&rsquo; that is used to light everything else, kinda similar to what Quake 3 does. And yes, that is a club mate gun.</p>
<p><img src="/fps_draw_indirect.png" alt="A screenshot from renderdoc showing the draw indirect calls"></p>
<p>Objects can either be static or animated, and either opaque, alpha-clipped or alpha-blended. They are rendered using Multi-Draw Indirect, so a maximum of 6 draw calls are sent out to render all objects, which is a system that I think is super cool. Animated objects are animated via a <a href="https://github.com/expenses/fps/blob/master/crates/animation/src/lib.rs">gltf skinning crate</a> of my own design, which took some effort to write because animations are super hard to debug, but I fully understand all of it now which is great. After this I kinda decided that I didn&rsquo;t like gameplay programming at all.</p>
<h2 id="cheesehttpsgithubcomexpensescheese-2020"><a href="https://github.com/expenses/cheese">Cheese</a> (2020)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rust with <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs">wgpu-rs</a></li>
<li>~ 9000 lines of code (8500 rust, 400 glsl)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/cheese.png" alt="An image montage of mice wearing space helmets"></p>
<p>A Real Time Strategy Game I made for the 2020 Github Game Off. I put a ton of work into this over the course of the month, and I think it shows. RTSes are definitely not the most fun kind of game (for me) to write, and I got pretty burnt-out towards the end of this. I learnt a ton about writing shaders and effects such as bloom and shadows. The shadow implementation could definitely be better, I might switch it to Cascaded Shadow Maps at some point.</p>

<h2 id="tilegenhttpsgithubcomexpensestilegen-2020"><a href="https://github.com/expenses/tilegen">Tilegen</a> (2020)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>~ 550 lines of code</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/tilegen.png" alt="Two top down images consisting of small tiles. The top shows cities and roads and rivers, while the bottom shows a snowy alien landscape with caves and frozen lakes"></p>
<p>A fun little project to procedurally generate images from a set of rules about what tiles can be neighbours via <a href="https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse">WaveFunctionCollapse</a>. See the readme for more info!</p>
<h2 id="hectic-rshttpsgithubcomexpenseshectic-rs-2020"><a href="https://github.com/expenses/hectic-rs">Hectic-rs</a> (2020)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rust with <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs">wgpu-rs</a></li>
<li>~ 2500 lines of code</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/hectic-rs.png" alt="A top-down view of a witch fighting against some flying skulls"></p>
<p>A rewrite of <a href="#hectic-2017">Hectic</a> below. My first time trying out a more modern graphics API in the form of <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs">wgpu-rs</a>, which fixed a ton of my problems with OpenGL. Features a bunch of improvements such as being able to change the window size and rotated projectiles etc. Definitely doesn&rsquo;t have a perfect renderer for a 2D game, but I&rsquo;m learning :P.</p>
<p>Playable online at expenses.github.io/hectic-rs-wasm using <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/wiki/Implementation-Status#firefox">a browser with webgpu enabled</a>, although this could break at any time.</p>
<h2 id="nebulawarhttpsgithubcomexpensesnebulawar-2018-2020"><a href="https://github.com/expenses/nebulawar">Nebulawar</a> (2018, 2020)</h2>
<p><img src="/nebulawar.png" alt="An image of some space ships and an asteroid against against a purple nebula background"></p>
<ul>
<li>Rust and OpenGL</li>
<li>Updated to wgpu-rs in 2020.</li>
<li>~ 4000 lines of code</li>
</ul>
<p>My first foray into 3D graphics programming. I didn&rsquo;t get very far in terms of actual gameplay, but at least it looks quite pretty. Has some fun randomly generated things like a randomly background mesh that consists of points on a sphere <a href="https://simonschreibt.de/gat/homeworld-2-backgrounds/">similar to what Homeworld 1 &amp; 2 do</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hectichttpsgithubcomexpenseshectic-2017"><a href="https://github.com/expenses/hectic">Hectic</a> (2017)</h2>
<p><img src="/hectic.png" alt="A top-down view of a boss fight between two witches"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a></li>
<li>~ 1200 lines of code</li>
</ul>
<p>A small bullet hell game I made for a computer graphics course. It&rsquo;s pretty cool, and I&rsquo;m still quite proud of it. I came up with this binary search thing so that enemies followed spline curves at a constant speed which I think was a neat invention. Also see <a href="#hectic-rs-2020">Hectic-rs</a> above.</p>
<h2 id="war-against-machineshttpsgithubcomexpenseswar-against-machines-2017---2018"><a href="https://github.com/expenses/war-against-machines/">War Against Machines</a> (2017 - 2018)</h2>
<p><img src="/war-against-machines.png" alt="An isometric view of some soldiers on a 2D grid"></p>
<ul>
<li>Rust and OpenGL</li>
<li>~ 5000 lines of code</li>
</ul>
<p>My first foray into graphics programming. Doesn&rsquo;t reflect my current abilities! It has networked multiplayer which is pretty cool. I didn&rsquo;t do a good job of fixing dependency versions, so it&rsquo;s not actually runnable at present.</p>
